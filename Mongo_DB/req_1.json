  "longDescription": "MongoDB is a document-oriented database that's highly scalable and delivers very high-performance, especially with massive data sets that need to be spread across multiple servers. It blends the things you expect with any database   like indexing, querying, and high availability   with powerful new features like easy horizontal scaling (\"auto-sharding\"), map/reduce aggregation, and a flexible document data model to support dynamic schemas.    MongoDB In Action is a comprehensive guide to MongoDB for application developers. The book begins by explaining what makes MongoDB unique and describing its ideal use cases. A series of tutorials designed for MongoDB mastery then leads into detailed examples for leveraging MongoDB in e-commerce, social networking, analytics, and other common applications.    Along the way, all of MongoDB's major features are covered, including:        * Indexes and explain plans for efficient queries      * Atomic operations for managing simple data structures and manipulating complex, rich documents      * GridFS for storing and managing large binary objects (images, videos, etc.) in MongoDB      * Map-reduce for custom aggregations and reporting      * Master-slave replication and replica sets for automated failover      * Auto-sharding for automated horizontal scaling    The handy reference section on schema design patterns will help ease the transition from the relational data model of SQL to MongoDB's document-based data model. The numerous, detailed examples are implemented in Ruby and include comprehensive explanations.    MongoDB has been gaining traction in the developer community for its speed, flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. With production deployments that include SourceForge, Foursquare, and Shutterfly, MongoDB is proving to be a robust and reliable database system that keeps developers happy. Covering everything from installation to application design to deployment, MongoDB In Action is written for the application developer who wants to take advantage of MongoDB and get up and running quickly.",

  "shortDescription": "Many software projects fail unnecessarily because of unclear objectives, redundant and unproductive work, cost overruns, and a host of other avoidable process problems. In response, agile processes and lightweight tooling have begun to replace traditional engineering processes throughout the development lifecycle. An agile approach to application lifecycle management improves product quality, reduces time to market, and makes for happier developers.    Agile ALM is a guide for Java developers who want to integrate flexible agile practices and lightweight tooling along all phases of the software development process. The book introduces a new vision for managing change in requirements and process more efficiently and flexibly. You'll learn powerful practices like task-based Development, where you align activities into tasks resulting in traceable artifacts, Continuous Integration, in which you frequently and systematically integrate, build, and test an application in development and using Scrum as an agile approach to release management. The effect is a more comprehensive and practical approach to build, configuration, deployment, release, test, quality, integration, and requirements management.    This book synthesizes technical and functional elements to provide a comprehensive approach to software development. You'll learn to see the whole scope of the development process as a set of defined tasks, many of which are repeated daily, and then master the tools and practices you need to accomplish each of those tasks efficiently.    Because efficient tool chains can radically improve the speed and fluidity of the development process, this book demonstrates how to integrate state-of-the-art lightweight tools. Many of the tools and examples are Java-based, but the Agile ALM principles apply to all development platforms. As well, the many examples show how you can bridge different languages and systems.",

  "longDescription": "In Windows, there's a control panel, dialog box, administrative console, API, or wizard to manage every component of your system. There are    thousands    of them   so many that it can be nearly impossible to keep track of all the locations and settings you need to administer Windows effectively. For administrators, PowerShell is a godsend because it provides a single, unified command line from which you can control and automate every aspect of Windows. PowerShell finally enables Windows administrators to work in a way that Unix and Linux administrators have leveraged for decades.    Like classic administrative shells, PowerShell accepts and immediately executes typed commands. In addition, it has all the features of a full-fledged programming language built in, so you can create scripts to automate even the most complex tasks. And it's fully aware of all the components of Windows and most Windows servers, so you can use PowerShell to control Exchange, IIS, SharePoint, and other core pieces of your Windows system.

By working through the numerous examples and tutorials, you'll master the APIs used to work with a phone's sensors and hardware, such as the accelerometer, camera, touch screen, GPS, and microphone. You'll also tackle web services and applications that use location and push notification services.    Along the way, you'll discover why Microsoft opted for Silverlight and XNA as the core technologies for WP7. As with Silverlight for the desktop, you can create stunning visual effects using C#. Silverlight for Windows Phone has been enriched with navigation services, a new execution model to better satisfy mobile requirements, and hooks for embedding a browser, playing media files, running cool animations, and more.    The XNA Framework provides libraries to handle 3D graphics, audio, and touch input. Because games are a key target of mobile app development, by the end of the book you will be able to write your own XNA game, utilizing the unique input abilities of the phone. You also learn how to tune your game code to get the best performance while running in the phone's constrained environment.",

  "longDescription": "It's been said that data is the new \"dirt\"   the raw material from which and on which you build the structures of the modern world. And like dirt, data can seem like a limitless, undifferentiated mass. The ability to take raw data, access it, filter it, process it, visualize it, understand it, and communicate it to others is possibly the most essential business problem for the coming decades.    \"Machine learning,\" the process of automating tasks once considered the domain of highly-trained analysts and mathematicians, is the key to efficiently extracting useful information from this sea of raw data. By implementing the core algorithms of statistical data processing, data analysis, and data visualization as reusable computer code, you can scale your capacity for data analysis well beyond the capabilities of individual knowledge workers.    Machine Learning in Action is a unique book that blends the foundational theories of machine learning with the practical realities of building tools for everyday data analysis. In it, you'll use the flexible Python programming language to build programs that implement algorithms for data classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification.    As you work through the numerous examples, you'll explore key topics like classification, numeric prediction, and clustering. Along the way, you'll be introduced to important established algorithms, such as Apriori, through which you identify association patterns in large datasets and Adaboost, a meta-algorithm that can increase the efficiency of many machine learning tasks.",

  "shortDescription": "Scala in Depth is a unique new book designed to help you integrate Scala effectively into your development process. By presenting the emerging best practices and designs from the Scala community, it guides you though dozens of powerful techniques example by example. There's no heavy-handed theory here-just lots of crisp, practical guides for coding in Scala.    For example:        * Discover the \"sweet spots\" where object-oriented and functional programming intersect.      * Master advanced OO features of Scala, including type member inheritance, multiple inheritance and composition.      * Employ functional programming concepts like tail recursion, immutability, and monadic operations.      * Learn good Scala style to keep your code concise, expressive and readable.    As you dig into the book, you'll start to appreciate what makes Scala really shine. For instance, the Scala type system is very, very powerful; this book provides use case approaches to manipulating the type system and covers how to use type constraints to enforce design constraints. Java developers love Scala's deep integration with Java and the JVM Ecosystem, and this book shows you how to leverage it effectively and work around the rough spots.",
  "longDescription": "Scala is a unique and powerful new programming language for the JVM. Blending the strengths of the Functional and Imperative programming models, Scala is a great tool for building highly concurrent applications without sacrificing the benefits of an OO approach. While information about the Scala language is abundant, skilled practitioners, great examples, and insight into the best practices of the community are harder to find. Scala in Depth bridges that gap, preparing you to adopt Scala successfully for real world projects.

  "longDescription": "The Java community has always been dynamic and fast-moving, with constant innovation on the core platform as well as a vibrant community ecosystem. New JVM-based languages like Groovy, Scala, and Clojure are redefining what it means to be a Java developer. The core Standard and Enterprise APIs now co-exist with a large and growing body of open source technologies. Multicore processors, concurrency, and massive data stores require new patterns and approaches to development. And with Java 7 due to release in 2011, there's still more to absorb.
